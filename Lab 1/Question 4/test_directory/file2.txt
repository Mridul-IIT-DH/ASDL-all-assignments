Question 1 (Count Files)
Count the number of text files starting with a given prefix within a given
directory.
Write a script count_files.sh that takes the following arguments
Path of the directory: This is where you will search for the files
Prefix: Only files whose names begin with the specified prefix shall be
counted
Recursive (true or false): This parameter will only take values "true"
or "false". If recursive is set to true then you also need to search
for the subdirectories in the path mentioned. Otherwise you will only
report the files present in the root of the directory mentioned
Note: Script has to give the output to stdout. If the path is invalid (not a
directory) or passed parameters are not valid then your script should output
relevant error messages and exit with error code -1.
bash ./count_files.sh <directory_path> <prefix> <recursive>
Examples:

Directory structure of /Users/mtech
.
├── 1.txt
├── 2.txt
├── abc1.txt
├── abc2.txt
└── subdir
├── 4.txt
└── abc3.txt

bash ./count_files.sh . abc true
3
Recursive search is enabled thus sub directory is included. For the directory
path I have passed "." which means current directory. Files counted are abc1.txt,
abc2.txt and abc3.txt.

bash ./count_files.sh /Users/mtech abc true
3
Recursive search is enabled thus sub directory is included. Files counted are
abc1.txt, abc2.txt and abc3.txt

bash ./count_files.sh /Users/mtech abc false
2
Recursive search is disabled thus sub directory is excluded. Files counted are
abc1.txt and abc2.txt/

bash ./count_files.sh /Users/mtech "" false
6
Prefix passed is empty thus the script will count all the txt files.

bash ./count_files.sh /Users/mtech/lolo "" false (TODO Check)
/Users/mtech/lolo is not a valid directory
and exit with error code -1

bash ./count_files.sh . "" true2
recursive should take only true or false values
and exit with error code -1
