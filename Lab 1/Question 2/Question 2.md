Sure! Hereâ€™s the updated documentation for the `evaluation.sh` script based on the new code you provided:

# Documentation for `evaluation.sh`

## Overview

The `evaluation.sh` script is a Bash shell script designed to read arithmetic operations from an input file and compute the final result of these operations. It supports integer operations including addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (`%`). The script outputs the result of each operation and the final computed value after processing all lines in the input file.

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Checks for the presence of an input file and verifies its validity.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports five basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
- **Error Handling**: Provides relevant error messages for invalid input or operations, including division by zero.
- **Output**: Displays the result of each operation and the final computed value.

## Usage

### Step 1: Save the Script

Save the following script code into a file named `evaluation.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the input file is provided as an argument
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <input_file>"
  exit -1
fi

# Check if the input file exists and is a regular file
if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "Error: $1 is not a valid file path."
  exit -1
fi

# Initialize the current value to 0
current_value=0

# Read the input file line by line
while read -r line; do
  # Split the line into operand1, operator, and operand2
  read -r operand1 operator <<< "$line"

  # Perform the arithmetic operation based on the operator
  case "$operator" in
    "+") current_value=$((current_value + operand1))
         ;;
    "-") current_value=$((current_value - operand1))
         ;;
    "*") current_value=$((current_value * operand1))
         ;;
    "/") 
        # Check for division by zero
        if [ "$operand1" -eq 0 ]; then
          echo "Error: Division by zero."
          exit -1
        fi
        current_value=$((current_value / operand1))
        ;;
    "%") 
        # Check for division by zero
        if [ "$operand1" -eq 0 ]; then
          echo "Error: Division by zero."
          exit -1
        fi
        current_value=$((current_value % operand1))
        ;;
    *)   echo "Error: Invalid operator '$operator'."
         exit -1
         ;;
  esac

  # Output the current value after the operation
  echo "$current_value"
done < "$1"

# Output the final value
echo "Final value: $current_value"
```

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

Run the following command in the terminal to make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x evaluation.sh
```

### Step 3: Prepare the Input File

Create a text file (e.g., `input.txt`) containing the arithmetic operations. Each line should have the format:

```
<operand1> <operator>
```

#### Example Content for `input.txt`:

```plaintext
10 +
20 -
2 *
4 /
10 +
2 %
```

### Step 4: Execute the Script

Run the script by providing the input file as an argument:

```bash
./evaluation.sh input.txt
```

## Script Breakdown

### 1. Shebang Line

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
Specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

### 2. Input Argument Check

```bash
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <input_file>"
  exit -1
fi
```
Checks if exactly one argument (the input file) is provided. If not, it outputs a usage message and exits with an error code.

### 3. File Existence Check

```bash
if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "Error: $1 is not a valid file path."
  exit -1
fi
```
Verifies if the provided argument is a valid file. If the file does not exist or is not a regular file, it outputs an error message and exits.

### 4. Initialize Current Value

```bash
current_value=0
```
Initializes a variable `current_value` to store the cumulative result of the arithmetic operations.

### 5. Read Input File

```bash
while read -r line; do
```
Reads the input file line by line.

### 6. Split Line into Components

```bash
read -r operand1 operator <<< "$line"
```
Splits each line into `operand1` and `operator`. Note that `operand2` is not used in this version of the script.

### 7. Perform Arithmetic Operations

```bash
case "$operator" in
  "+") current_value=$((current_value + operand1))
       ;;
  "-") current_value=$((current_value - operand1))
       ;;
  "*") current_value=$((current_value * operand1))
       ;;
  "/") 
      if [ "$operand1" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Error: Division by zero."
        exit -1
      fi
      current_value=$((current_value / operand1))
      ;;
  "%") 
      if [ "$operand1" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Error: Division by zero."
        exit -1
      fi
      current_value=$((current_value % operand1))
      ;;
  *)   echo "Error: Invalid operator '$operator'."
       exit -1
       ;;
esac
```
Uses a `case` statement to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the operator.

### 8. Output Current Value

```bash
echo "$current_value"
```
Outputs the current value after each operation.

### 9. Final Output

```bash
echo "Final value: $current_value"
```
After processing all lines, outputs the final computed value.

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for the following scenarios:
- Missing input file argument.
- Invalid file path.
- Invalid arithmetic operator.
- Division by zero.

In each case, the script outputs an appropriate error message and exits with an error code of `-1`.

## Conclusion

The `evaluation.sh` script is a straightforward and effective tool for performing a series of arithmetic operations defined in an input file. It emphasizes input validation and error handling, making it robust for various use cases. By following the provided instructions, users can easily utilize the script for their arithmetic evaluation needs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out!
