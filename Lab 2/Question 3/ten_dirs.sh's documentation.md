# Detailed Documentation for `ten_dirs.sh`

### Purpose
The `ten_dirs.sh` script creates a main directory named `ten`, generates ten subdirectories (`ten/dir01` through `ten/dir10`), and creates four files in each subdirectory with specific content. Each file contains lines consisting of digits as specified.

### Script Code
Here is the complete code for the `ten_dirs.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create the main directory 'ten'
mkdir -p ten

# Loop to create ten subdirectories and their respective files
for i in $(seq -w 1 10); do
    # Create subdirectory ten/dir01, ten/dir02, ..., ten/dir10
    dir_name="ten/dir$i"
    mkdir -p "$dir_name"

    # Create the four files in each subdirectory
    echo "1" > "$dir_name/file1.txt"
    echo -e "2\n2" > "$dir_name/file2.txt"
    echo -e "3\n3" > "$dir_name/file3.txt"
    echo -e "4\n4\n4\n4" > "$dir_name/file4.txt"
done
```

### Usage
To run the script, follow these steps:
1. Save the script as `ten_dirs.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ten_dirs.sh
   ```
3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   ./ten_dirs.sh
   ```

### Script Breakdown
1. **Creating the Main Directory**:
   - The script begins by creating a main directory named `ten` using `mkdir -p ten`. The `-p` option ensures that no error is raised if the directory already exists. This is important because it allows the script to run multiple times without failing if the directory is already present.

2. **Looping to Create Subdirectories**:
   - The `for` loop iterates over a sequence generated by `seq -w 1 10`. 
     - The `-w` option ensures that the numbers are zero-padded to two digits (e.g., `01`, `02`, ..., `10`). This is necessary for consistent formatting of directory names, which is crucial for maintaining an orderly structure. Without zero-padding, the directories would be named `dir1`, `dir10`, `dir2`, etc., leading to an incorrect order when listed.
   - Inside the loop, `dir_name` is constructed to represent each subdirectory (e.g., `ten/dir01`, `ten/dir02`, etc.).
   - The `mkdir -p "$dir_name"` command creates each subdirectory. The `-p` option again ensures that no error is raised if the directory already exists.

3. **Creating Files in Each Subdirectory**:
   - For each subdirectory, four files are created:
     - `file1.txt` contains one line with the digit `1`.
     - `file2.txt` contains two lines, each with the digit `2`.
     - `file3.txt` contains two lines, each with the digit `3`.
     - `file4.txt` contains four lines, each with the digit `4`.
   - The `echo` command is used to write the desired content to each file. The `-e` option allows for the interpretation of escape sequences like `\n` for new lines. This is essential for formatting the content correctly in the files.

### Example
When you run the script:
```bash
./ten_dirs.sh
```

The following directory structure will be created:

```
ten/
├── dir01/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   ├── file2.txt
│   ├── file3.txt
│   └── file4.txt
├── dir02/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   ├── file2.txt
│   ├── file3.txt
│   └── file4.txt
├── dir03/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   ├── file2.txt
│   ├── file3.txt
│   └── file4.txt
├── dir04/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   ├── file2.txt
│   ├── file3.txt
│   └── file4.txt
├── dir05/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   ├── file2.txt
│   ├── file3.txt
│   └── file4.txt
├── dir06/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   ├── file2.txt
│   ├── file3.txt
│   └── file4.txt
├── dir07/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   ├── file2.txt
│   ├── file3.txt
│   └── file4.txt
├── dir08/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   ├── file2.txt
│   ├── file3.txt
│   └── file4.txt
├── dir09/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   ├── file2.txt
│   ├── file3.txt
│   └── file4.txt
└── dir10/
    ├── file1.txt
    ├── file2.txt
    ├── file3.txt
    └── file4.txt
```

Each `fileX.txt` in the respective directories will contain the specified number of lines with the corresponding digits:
- `file1.txt`: Contains `1`
- `file2.txt`: Contains `2` on two lines
- `file3.txt`: Contains `3` on two lines
- `file4.txt`: Contains `4` on four lines

### Conclusion
The `ten_dirs.sh` script efficiently creates a structured directory with subdirectories and files as specified. It uses a loop and the `seq` command to automate the creation process, ensuring that the solution is dynamic and not hard-coded. The detailed documentation explains the purpose, usage, script code, breakdown, and key commands used in the script, along with the reasoning behind specific options and commands to enhance understanding.
