# Detailed Documentation for `digits.sh`

### Purpose
The `digits.sh` script counts the numbers between 1000 and 2000 (inclusive) that contain the digit 2 in one or more of their digits. It prints the total count to standard output.

### Script Code
Here is the complete code for the `digits.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

seq 1000 2000 | grep -c '2'
```

### Usage
To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
bash digits.sh
```

### Script Breakdown
1. **Generating the Number Sequence**:
   - The `seq` command generates a sequence of numbers from 1000 to 2000 (inclusive) and writes them to stdout.

2. **Searching for the Digit 2**:
   - The output of `seq` is piped to `grep`, which searches for the pattern '2' in each number.
   - The `-c` option of `grep` counts the number of lines (numbers) that match the pattern and prints the total count to stdout.

### Explanation of Key Commands

#### 1. `seq`
- **Definition**: The `seq` command generates a sequence of numbers or strings.

- **Syntax**:
  ```
  seq [OPTION]... [FIRST[INCREMENT]]LAST
  ```
  - **OPTION**: Modifiers that change the behavior of `seq`.
  - **FIRST**: The first number in the sequence (default is 1).
  - **INCREMENT**: The increment value (default is 1).
  - **LAST**: The last number in the sequence.

- **Functionality**: `seq` writes the generated sequence to stdout, separated by newlines.

- **Example Usage**:
  To generate numbers from 1 to 5:
  ```bash
  seq 1 5
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  ```

#### 2. `grep`
- **Definition**: `grep` stands for "global regular expression print". It is a command-line utility used to search for specific patterns within files or input data.

- **Syntax**:
  ```
  grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
  ```
  - **OPTION**: Modifiers that change the behavior of `grep`.
  - **PATTERN**: The string or regular expression to search for.
  - **FILE**: One or more files to search. If no file is specified, `grep` reads from standard input.

- **Functionality**: `grep` scans each line of input and prints lines that match the specified pattern. It supports regular expressions, allowing for complex search patterns.

- **Common Options**:
  - `-c`: Counts the number of matching lines and prints the total count.

- **Example Usage**:
  To count the number of lines containing the string "apple" in a file called `fruits.txt`:
  ```bash
  grep -c "apple" fruits.txt
  ```

### Example
When you run the script:
```bash
bash digits.sh
```

The output will be the total count of numbers between 1000 and 2000 (inclusive) that contain the digit 2:
```
300
```

This means that there are 300 numbers in the specified range that contain the digit 2 in one or more of their digits.

### Conclusion
The `digits.sh` script efficiently counts the numbers between 1000 and 2000 (inclusive) that contain the digit 2 by using the `seq` command to generate the number sequence and `grep` to search for the pattern '2'. The detailed documentation explains the purpose, usage, script code, breakdown, and key commands used in the script.
